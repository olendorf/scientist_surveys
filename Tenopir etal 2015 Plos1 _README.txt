After cleaning, a total n of 2344 respondents had answered at least one question. The data consists of two sections: questions about demographics and questions about scientists’ relationships with data. Subjects provided data about their age, the sector they work in, their subject discipline, their professional position, their primary funding agency, and their primary country/state of employment. Responses from the baseline study (n = 1329) are coded under “survey” as 1, and responses from the follow-up survey (n = 1015) are coded as 2. Age category and continent of employment (our operationalization of “geographic region”) were also derived for analysis. The variable labeled “NAvsNonNA” (North American vs. non-North American respondents) was created to control for the significant increase in internationality from the baseline to the follow-up study. As for scientists’ data practices and perceptions, the data comes from several different types of questions. Respondents were asked to what degree they agree or disagree with a series of statements, in addition to some yes/no and “check all that apply” questions that are converted into yes/no responses in the data file to enable comparison of baseline and follow-up responses. For agree/disagree scale items (1-5) in the follow-up data, a 6th option was included as “don’t know” or “not sure;” these responses are counted as missing. Each question or statement explored a different aspect of data issues: the value of data sharing and reuse, willingness to engage in data sharing and reuse, perceived risks of data sharing and reuse, barriers to data sharing, accessibility of their data, metadata standards used, satisfaction with data practices, and perceptions of organizational support for data management and policies.
