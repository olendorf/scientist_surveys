## Description

This data is derived from three previous surveys performed by members of DataONE to gauge scientists' attitudes and practices
around data sharing and data management, and also to determine their satisfaction with the resources provided to them for sharing
and data management. The data and analysis here are a subset of the questions from those three surveys.

## Data Sources

The data for this analysis was taken from three previous surveys of scientists' attitudes and paractices 
concerning data management and sharing.


Data from the [1st scientists survey paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021101)

  * Survey data used in this paper is available on [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6t94p)

Data from the [2nd scientists survey paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134826)

  * Survey data used in this paper is available on [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.1ph92)

Data from the [3rd scientists survey paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018EA000461)

## Usage

To rerun the entire analysis 

```r
source('path/to/main.R')
```

The data cleaning, analysis and visualizations are contained in separate files in the `script/` directory. The individuals 
scripts likely rely on objects created from previous scripts run in the sequence, and therefore probably cannot be run as 
stand alone scripts.

The data from the three surveys are in the `data/` directory `<nth>_scientists_survey.csv`.

## Known Issues

On some Macs, the `ggpubr` package won't load properly resulting in an error `could not find function "ggexport"`. There are a few 
dependencies that fail to install for `ggpubr`. There are ways to install the dependecies as shown in [this blog](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/rcpp-rcpparmadillo-and-os-x-mavericks-lgfortran-and-lquadmath-error).
Alternatively, the `ggexport()` function is not strictly necessary, and is used to build a graphics array. If the graphics array
isn't needed `ggsave()` will work, or substitute other packages that can generate the graphics array.
