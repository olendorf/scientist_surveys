## Description

This data is derived from three previous surveys performed by members of DataONE to gauge scientists' attitudes and practices
around data sharing and data management, and also to determine their satisfaction with the resources provided to them for sharing
and data management. The data and analysis here are a subset of the questions from those three surveys.

## Data Sources

The data for this analysis was taken from three previous surveys of scientists' attitudes and paractices 
concerning data management and sharing.

## Usage

To rerun the entire analysis 

```r
source('path/to/main.R')
```

The data cleaning, analysis and visualizations are contained in separate files in the `script/` directory. The individuals 
scripts likely rely on objects created from previous scripts run in the sequence, and therefore probably cannot be run as 
stand alone scripts.

The data from the three surveys are in the `data/` directory `<nth>_scientists_survey.csv`.
